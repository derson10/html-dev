        and face challenges. They are hardworking, have an enormous physical disposition and
        demonstrate a lot of determination and perseverance. What characterizes this profile is
        their willpower. tends to the logical/deductive and their imagination and judgment are
        usually balanced. <abbr>They enjoy challenges</abbr> and obstacles stimulate them to act more and
        more. They tend to execute first, then think about how to do it.</h2> </blockquote>
    

    <h2>They have autonomy, independence and know how to impose themselves on others. <blockquote>They
        are self-confident and have <del>leadership</del> characteristics. A point to develop is that they can
        be authoritarian and somewhat inflexible, because they believe in their point of view, and
        this leads them to fight for your ideals. Therefore, this profile is suitable for quick tasks
        that require initiative and determination. It is important to understand that for this profile
        there are no obstacles, and if there are, he will overcome them without measuring efforts.</h2></blockquote>

    <font face="Helvetica" color="red"><h3>LOOK THE <abbr title="TOP EXECUTOR SUBFACTORS">TES</abbr></h3></font>
    <p><strong>DETERMINATION</strong><br>
        <mark>This subfactor appears when the <u>Executor</u> is considerably taller than the Communicator.</mark> If he does not have any
        <sup>Communicator</sup> sociability, then this person will have little interest in personal matters, so determination is
        prominent. This person has an objective view in relation to things and has focus, not giving up on their goals.
        Because they need to see the result of their work, this person can compromise on  <small>quality and details.</small>
    </p>

    <p><strong>INDEPENDENCES</strong><br>
        <mark>This subfactor appears when the <u>Executor</u> profile is higher than the Analyst profile.</mark> Because this individual is more
        independent, being subjected to rules and procedures will frustrate him. works in a more isolated way, very typical
        of an entrepreneur. </p>

    <p><strong>AUTOMOTIVE</strong><br>
        <mark><u>Self-motivation</u> appears when there is no need for security and passivity from the <sub>Planner (high).</sub></mark> Then action
        becomes a key ingredient in this subfactor. This person needs to be active all the time and is very impatient with
        those who are unwilling or unable to keep up with its pace. It seeks to pursue its ambitions and goals hard.
